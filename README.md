# Neural Network QoS Routing for Real-Time WANs

Event-driven simulation comparing ML-based routing against traditional algorithms 
(Dijkstra, Widest-Path, Min-Delay) for deadline-sensitive traffic in wide-area networks.

**Tech Stack:** Python, NetworkX, SimPy, PyTorch  
**Focus:** Deadline-aware routing with admission control and schedulability analysis
